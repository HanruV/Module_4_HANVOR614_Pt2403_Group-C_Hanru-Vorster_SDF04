removed majority of the styles for the buttons so i could build them from the ground up.


btn-1: I wanted to make a button where the colors reverse when clicked on. I chose some soft colors, but also with enough contrast to see the text clearly. I decided to keep the button background color similar to the background color of the main content. I did increase the value slightlyu just for readability.

btn-2: I wanted to make a button that appeared like it was 3D. Ran into difficluty with the shadow being on the outside, and fixed using the "instet" property. The hover makes the cursor appear like its resting and pushing in the button somewhat. when Clicked the button pushes in by stimply removing the shadows. 

btn-3: For this button i wanted to make it wiggle when hovered over like a spring action.
